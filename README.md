For all of the plots the lines appear on the frequencies we're interested in (only go to second harmonics).  Lines are colour coded - green is a satellite-only harmonic, yellow is star-only harmonic, magenta is a combination

fft_power_peaks_rhessi_5.png: Fourier spectrum of the RHESSI data for the average of the detectors away from the scatterer (black), detector 8 (blue), and detector 9 (red).  Regions around harmonics containing 2fsat are shown.

fft_power_peaks_sample2_89.png: Fourier spectrum of the hand-generated data for the average of the detectors away from the scatterer (black), detector 8 (blue), and detector 9 (red).  Regions around large peaks are shown.  This sample data had a polarized 8/9 detector at a different phase from fft_power_peaks_sample_89.png.

fft_power_peaks_sample_35.png: Fourier spectrum of the hand-generated data for the average of the detectors away from the scatterer (black), detector 3 (blue), and detector 5 (red).  Regions around large peaks are shown.
